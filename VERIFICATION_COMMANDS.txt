Bandana Clip Studio - Verification Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)
==============================================================

# Navigate to project
cd ~/Desktop/tech/projects/bandana_clip_studio

# Test full setup (will recreate venv and install dependencies)
./start_bandana.sh

# After setup completes, test quick restart
./run_local.sh

# Alternative: Use Makefile
make setup
make run

# Clean everything and start fresh
make clean
make setup

Expected Output Verification:
✅ No "Defaulting to user installation" messages
✅ No opencv source compilation (fast wheel install)
✅ Success line: "✅ OK Python 3.12.4 | OpenCV 4.8.1 | macOS 10.15.x"
✅ Streamlit launches at http://localhost:8501

Troubleshooting:
- If Python 3.12 not found, script will fall back to python3.11 or python3
- If opencv build starts, stop with Ctrl+C and check requirements.txt pins
- If "user installation" appears, the venv is broken and will be recreated
